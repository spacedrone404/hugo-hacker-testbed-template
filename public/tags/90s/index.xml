      <description>&#xA;Tired of crappy holywood detective action stories? Here is a couple of really decent ones. Swedish at this time.

      <description>I think that people are sicking tired of cheap computer graphics. Everything is so plastic and unnaturally glossy these days. Miss those real video effects from early 90s. And yeah, they were so atmospheric, especially amplified effect of beam light coming out of backdrop. Evil Dead is very neat example, just look at these pieces. Make sure to watch S-Mart scene!&#xA;Evil Dead I Ending Scene Evil Dead ][ Cabin Run Evil Dead ][ Ending Scene Evil Dead ]I[ S-Mart End BLOG UPDATE ► full theme refactoring, made it more 90&amp;rsquo;ish, RGB and stuff, you know what i&amp;rsquo;m saying, fixed some issues</description>
