      <description>&#xA;[Bubba Ho-Tep] is a quite awkward movie, but despite that is worth watching. The main reasons of such conclusion are [Bruce Campbell] and [Brian Tyler]. Bruce is surely known for his [Evil Dead] acting. Brian provided stunning soundtrack, which lifts whole movie to another level.&#xA;OFFICIAL TRAILER&#xA;Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>

      <description>&#xA;Tired of crappy holywood detective action stories? Here is a couple of really decent ones. Swedish at this time. Quite boring at the beginning, but surprisingly intense in the end. Good acting is also here.&#xA;[The Hunters] [The Hunters 2: False Trail]&#xA;THE HUNTERS [1996] FALSE TRAIL [2011] Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>
