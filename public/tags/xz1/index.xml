      <description>As you may know [Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact] is my main web surfing phone on the go. I&amp;rsquo;m fully satisfied with it&amp;rsquo;s capabilities even in 2023. Except one little problem, related to GPS and speed of satellites detection.&#xA;Issue showed up couple of months ago and it seems that i finally found an easy way to fix it. After some investigations i conclude that device has a hardware based problem, and to eliminate it completely you need to open phone casing and pull up antenna so it will have tighter surface touching with in-case metallic plate.</description>

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-04-19&#xA;Most modern marketing smart-phones are mumbling about support of really large SD cards. But only on Hi-End models. I&amp;rsquo;m not even speaking about pathetic iphones, which are disabled in terms of external storage due to the greed of executive directors. In this note i will check old mastodonts like:&#xA;[Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact [2017]] [Nokia PureView 808 [2012]] for compatibility with such ENORMOUS storage device.&#xA;Sony XZ1 Compact handles such capacity without any problems.</description>
