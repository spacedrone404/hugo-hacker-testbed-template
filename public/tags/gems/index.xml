      <description>So you want to do something evil or make a present for the April&amp;rsquo;s Fool Day to your surrounding. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to use the professional keyboard application [FilterKeys Setter] in its meanest form, will set keyboard filters to skip keystrokes, but only if the person starts typing at a faster rate.&#xA;I find out that the easiest way is to set Ignore Under parameter somewhere around 60ms, so it will be not so obvious in the beginning for the end user, that key strokes are skipping.</description>

      <description>Although I have been using Linux more and more in recent work, Windows 7 remains my main production operating system. And here is an excellent finding for Windows 7 crony named [Capster]. Its main functionality is to launch the specified executable at startup time when the [CAPS LOCK] key is set to ON or OFF. I use Capser to run backup script, that backs up previously selected folders [if i want to].</description>

      <description>&#xA;[Bubba Ho-Tep] is a quite awkward movie, but despite that is worth watching. The main reasons of such conclusion are [Bruce Campbell] and [Brian Tyler]. Bruce is surely known for his [Evil Dead] acting. Brian provided stunning soundtrack, which lifts whole movie to another level.&#xA;OFFICIAL TRAILER&#xA;Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>

      <description>Is an ambitious project to replicate Fallout 1 world using Fallout 4 engine. Currently game in it’s early stage of development, but location of Shady Sands was already showcased to the public.&#xA;Developers intend to redo original voice-over because of copyright trademarks. Moreover they are trying to copy voice aesthetics as close as possible to original Fallout 1. Also you can already preview multiple soundtracks created by [Radiofloyd].&#xA;As for me, I really like what they are doing, despite the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of Fallout 3/4.</description>

      <title>FALLOUT I/II ▀ BEST RPG EVER!</title>

      <description>My favorite game of all times. Thanks to it I’ve learn English [to some kind of degree] and even was almost expelled from university. What a neat memories. I was totally obsessed with deep &amp;ldquo;in game&amp;rdquo; atmosphere. Cyberpunk post-apocalyptic stuff, you know what I’m saying and those incredible ambient from master [Mark Morgan]. Can firmly confirm that modern series of this franchise don’t provide such immersion. As for backdrop music, Mark Morgan in Fallout ½ set quality bar to unreachable level.</description>

      <description>I think that people are sicking tired of cheap computer graphics. Everything is so plastic and unnaturally glossy these days. Miss those real video effects from early 90s. And yeah, they were so atmospheric, especially amplified effect of beam light coming out of backdrop. Evil Dead is very neat example, just look at these pieces. Make sure to watch S-Mart scene!&#xA;Evil Dead I Ending Scene Evil Dead ][ Cabin Run Evil Dead ][ Ending Scene Evil Dead ]I[ S-Mart End BLOG UPDATE ► full theme refactoring, made it more 90&amp;rsquo;ish, RGB and stuff, you know what i&amp;rsquo;m saying, fixed some issues</description>
