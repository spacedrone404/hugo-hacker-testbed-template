      <description>So you want to do something evil or make a present for the April&amp;rsquo;s Fool Day to your surrounding. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to use the professional keyboard application [FilterKeys Setter] in its meanest form, will set keyboard filters to skip keystrokes, but only if the person starts typing at a faster rate.&#xA;I find out that the easiest way is to set Ignore Under parameter somewhere around 60ms, so it will be not so obvious in the beginning for the end user, that key strokes are skipping.</description>

So am i! That is why today we transform atrocious Windows 10 interface into clean looking heaven of classic Windows 7.</description>

      <description>In this note, I will describe all the settings you need to tweak to get a 100% flicker-free, eye-friendly result on your smartphone. However, some settings are quite extreme and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to apply all of them, such as the monochrome filter or setting extremely high warm values on the color temperature slider.&#xA;PWM flickering is a &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; of most digital displays at relatively low brightness levels that can cause eye strain and headaches.</description>

      <description>Although I have been using Linux more and more in recent work, Windows 7 remains my main production operating system. And here is an excellent finding for Windows 7 crony named [Capster]. Its main functionality is to launch the specified executable at startup time when the [CAPS LOCK] key is set to ON or OFF. I use Capser to run backup script, that backs up previously selected folders [if i want to].</description>

      <description>Say you are trying to install software and receive message from the operating system about untrusted certificate in certificate chain. In such case you need to import certificate of the middle-man organization into the Linux certificate storage to make things happen.&#xA;If for some reason your third-party certificate comes in DER binary format, you should convert it to CRT format:&#xA;openssl x509 -inform DER -in certificate.der -out certificate.crt Copy to storage:</description>

      <description>You might think that it is kinda ridiculous title, but read on to find out.&#xA;First of all you have to understand that i&amp;rsquo;m not going to share my personal bookmarks with some ugly copro that cloaks itself under the umbrella of free software ideas and use their lame anti-private sync. And i&amp;rsquo;m certainly not going to use any web service provided by these companies in any case.&#xA;Of course we won&amp;rsquo;t skip that generic rant part about how dumb project managers are for not implementing essential features like bookmark export or the ability to open local HTML files in 2024.</description>

      <description>First things first. I often need to copy substantial amount of photos from my phone. It can&amp;rsquo;t be done via Windows GUI without millions of mouse clicks or keystrokes. Here you will find a solution on how to do this in a proper way. The key tool for this will be [ADB], developer tools for Android.&#xA;Wishes: command line, batch, no file explorer, no mouse, no clickety-clack.&#xA;Sicking tired of all of these not-so-precise-instructions i&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make my own.</description>

      <description>As a hardcore user of [dual-panel orthodox file manager] i always suffered because of sucky look of default console fonts. Native preloaded font list has quite scarce selection, if you ask me. To fix such disappointment you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&#xA;install desired fonts by means of windows control panel copy EXACT FONT NAME fonts section in control panel paste it into registry key into following branch HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont note that every new subsequent font should be added by a key with added one zero to registry key name reboot computer to apply &amp;amp; enjoy!</description>

      <description>Vegas video montage software is widely known as pretty glitchy application especially if we are speaking about latest versions. Newest Vegas 21 Pro is no exception. I run into problems almost instantly. Right after i&amp;rsquo;ve decided to render video clip. Upon export attempt application showed me error:&#xA;0x80131501 How typical! To fix things up i just took DLL library [RenderAsDialog.dll, which is responsible for export dialog] from previous Vegas Pro 18 [sub-version 284 to be precise] and substituted original file with above mentioned.</description>

      <description>Recently i was asked for a simple &amp;amp; free way of transcribing audio speech into plain text. Problem was solved via Python library called [Vosk]. It is a speech recognition toolkit working in offline environment.&#xA;To make things happen do the following:&#xA;[Install vosk] pip install vosk [Download speech model] of required language, larger libraries bring just marginal improvement over the smaller ones despite the fact that they are over 40 times bigger in a size.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago i run into problem related to out-of sync time clock.

My Windows 7 installation dates back to early 2019 and i&amp;rsquo;ve plethora of software installed, and more over system is heavily customized so plain reinstall of operating system is not an option in my case.</description>

Very nice Android browser, but have one serious downside: limited amount of supported addons.

Everything is fine, except annoying update popup, which is opening right after every plugin initialization. Such stuff completely breaks workflow if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to update for some reason. And there is no way to turn it off from GUI using normal methods.&#xA;However, you can shut update checks off from configuration file, which is located here:</description>
