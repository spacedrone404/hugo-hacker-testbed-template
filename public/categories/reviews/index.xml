      <description>¶ INTRO WORDS Numbers, numbers, numbers &amp;hellip; i say NUMBERS!!!!&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since i ran into the craze of pointless benchmarks. And now I&amp;rsquo;m back with the absolute procrastination stuff. Are you happy with this?&#xA;Take a note that 3DMark 03, 3DMark 05, 3DMark 06, 3DMark Vantage [2007], 3DMark 2011 and 3DMark 2021 are not marked by ▒ sign, showing the fact that these programs lost the soul of demoscene and just providing comparison numbers, nothing else.</description>

      <description>&#xA;Tired of crappy holywood detective action stories? Here is a couple of really decent ones. Swedish at this time. Quite boring at the beginning, but surprisingly intense in the end. Good acting is also here.&#xA;[The Hunters] [The Hunters 2: False Trail]&#xA;THE HUNTERS [1996] FALSE TRAIL [2011] Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>

      <description>Is an ambitious project to replicate Fallout 1 world using Fallout 4 engine. Currently game in it’s early stage of development, but location of Shady Sands was already showcased to the public.&#xA;Developers intend to redo original voice-over because of copyright trademarks. Moreover they are trying to copy voice aesthetics as close as possible to original Fallout 1. Also you can already preview multiple soundtracks created by [Radiofloyd].&#xA;As for me, I really like what they are doing, despite the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of Fallout 3/4.</description>

      <description>Well known Chinese driver modder [Canonkong] confirmed that [64-cores/128-threads Threadripper 3995WX] based upon sWRX8 chipset works flawlessly in Windows 7 environment. Considering the news it looks like that more recent [5995WX] will also work without any issues. So, we have plenty of headroom in terms of system performance. As for me, i have no need to switch to &amp;ldquo;recent operating systems&amp;rdquo; like Windows 10/11.&#xA;Here is brief [confirmation] from the WinRaid forum:</description>

      <description>&#xA;Lightning fast text two-panel orthodox file manager with loads of functionality. These blue panels take very special place in my heart.

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-04-19&#xA;Most modern marketing smart-phones are mumbling about support of really large SD cards. But only on Hi-End models. I&amp;rsquo;m not even speaking about pathetic iphones, which are disabled in terms of external storage due to the greed of executive directors. In this note i will check old mastodonts like:&#xA;[Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact [2017]] [Nokia PureView 808 [2012]] for compatibility with such ENORMOUS storage device.&#xA;Sony XZ1 Compact handles such capacity without any problems.</description>

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-02-20 I recommend to replace Fennec F-Droid with [Mull Browser] due to the fact that is COMPLETELY free from telemetry. In contrast to Fennec Mull browser do not trigger any mozilla or google connections, so take a note. And for God&amp;rsquo;s sake do not use plain Firefox, it is almost like chrome now!&#xA;As my main web surfer IceCat begin to showing it’s age and don’t have any new versions apart from &amp;ldquo;super-new&amp;rdquo; 68.</description>

      <description>My favorite game of all times. Thanks to it I’ve learn English [to some kind of degree] and even was almost expelled from university. What a neat memories. I was totally obsessed with deep &amp;ldquo;in game&amp;rdquo; atmosphere. Cyberpunk post-apocalyptic stuff, you know what I’m saying and those incredible ambient from master [Mark Morgan]. Can firmly confirm that modern series of this franchise don’t provide such immersion. As for backdrop music, Mark Morgan in Fallout ½ set quality bar to unreachable level.</description>

      <description>I think that people are sicking tired of cheap computer graphics. Everything is so plastic and unnaturally glossy these days. Miss those real video effects from early 90s. And yeah, they were so atmospheric, especially amplified effect of beam light coming out of backdrop. Evil Dead is very neat example, just look at these pieces. Make sure to watch S-Mart scene!&#xA;Evil Dead I Ending Scene Evil Dead ][ Cabin Run Evil Dead ][ Ending Scene Evil Dead ]I[ S-Mart End BLOG UPDATE ► full theme refactoring, made it more 90&amp;rsquo;ish, RGB and stuff, you know what i&amp;rsquo;m saying, fixed some issues</description>
