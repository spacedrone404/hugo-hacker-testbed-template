      <description>&#xA;[Bubba Ho-Tep] is a quite awkward movie, but despite that is worth watching. The main reasons of such conclusion are [Bruce Campbell] and [Brian Tyler]. Bruce is surely known for his [Evil Dead] acting. Brian provided stunning soundtrack, which lifts whole movie to another level.&#xA;OFFICIAL TRAILER&#xA;Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>

      <description>&#xA;Tired of crappy holywood detective action stories? Here is a couple of really decent ones. Swedish at this time. Quite boring at the beginning, but surprisingly intense in the end. Good acting is also here.&#xA;[The Hunters] [The Hunters 2: False Trail]&#xA;THE HUNTERS [1996] FALSE TRAIL [2011] Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>

      <description>I think that people are sicking tired of cheap computer graphics. Everything is so plastic and unnaturally glossy these days. Miss those real video effects from early 90s. And yeah, they were so atmospheric, especially amplified effect of beam light coming out of backdrop. Evil Dead is very neat example, just look at these pieces. Make sure to watch S-Mart scene!&#xA;Evil Dead I Ending Scene Evil Dead ][ Cabin Run Evil Dead ][ Ending Scene Evil Dead ]I[ S-Mart End BLOG UPDATE ► full theme refactoring, made it more 90&amp;rsquo;ish, RGB and stuff, you know what i&amp;rsquo;m saying, fixed some issues</description>
