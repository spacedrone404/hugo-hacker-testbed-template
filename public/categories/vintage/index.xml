      <description>Although I have been using Linux more and more in recent work, Windows 7 remains my main production operating system. And here is an excellent finding for Windows 7 crony named [Capster]. Its main functionality is to launch the specified executable at startup time when the [CAPS LOCK] key is set to ON or OFF. I use Capser to run backup script, that backs up previously selected folders [if i want to].</description>

Here you will find a solution on how to do this in a proper way. The key tool for this will be [ADB], developer tools for Android.&#xA;Wishes: command line, batch, no file explorer, no mouse, no clickety-clack.&#xA;Sicking tired of all of these not-so-precise-instructions i&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make my own.</description>

      <description>As a hardcore user of [dual-panel orthodox file manager] i always suffered because of sucky look of default console fonts. Native preloaded font list has quite scarce selection, if you ask me. To fix such disappointment you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&#xA;install desired fonts by means of windows control panel copy EXACT FONT NAME fonts section in control panel paste it into registry key into following branch HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont note that every new subsequent font should be added by a key with added one zero to registry key name reboot computer to apply &amp;amp; enjoy!</description>

      <description>&#xA;[Bubba Ho-Tep] is a quite awkward movie, but despite that is worth watching. The main reasons of such conclusion are [Bruce Campbell] and [Brian Tyler]. Bruce is surely known for his [Evil Dead] acting. Brian provided stunning soundtrack, which lifts whole movie to another level.&#xA;OFFICIAL TRAILER&#xA;Imagery by spacedrone808 @Adobe Imagery by spacedrone808 @Freepik </description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago i run into problem related to out-of sync time clock. Tried almost all imaginable solutions, like time service restarting, checking that internet time-sync option is turned on and so on and so forth. Of course to no avail at all. How typical! My Windows 7 installation dates back to early 2019 and i&amp;rsquo;ve plethora of software installed, and more over system is heavily customized so plain reinstall of operating system is not an option in my case.</description>

      <description>As you may know [Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact] is my main web surfing phone on the go. I&amp;rsquo;m fully satisfied with it&amp;rsquo;s capabilities even in 2023. Except one little problem, related to GPS and speed of satellites detection.&#xA;Issue showed up couple of months ago and it seems that i finally found an easy way to fix it. After some investigations i conclude that device has a hardware based problem, and to eliminate it completely you need to open phone casing and pull up antenna so it will have tighter surface touching with in-case metallic plate.</description>

      <description>I often get asked regarding Windows 7 safety especially in 2023.&#xA;&amp;#34;Is it safe to use such old operating system?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;What about security?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;How about modern viruses?&amp;#34;&#xD;.... &amp;hellip;. and many other similar questions.&#xA;Funny thing that people who are asking about security don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about privacy. Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s quite different definitions for sure, but from my point of view they always come together hand in hand.&#xA;The main and the most important security police officer is your head.</description>

      <description>My favorite game of all times. Thanks to it Iâ€™ve learn English [to some kind of degree] and even was almost expelled from university. What a neat memories. I was totally obsessed with deep &amp;ldquo;in game&amp;rdquo; atmosphere. Cyberpunk post-apocalyptic stuff, you know what Iâ€™m saying and those incredible ambient from master [Mark Morgan]. Can firmly confirm that modern series of this franchise donâ€™t provide such immersion. As for backdrop music, Mark Morgan in Fallout Â½ set quality bar to unreachable level.</description>
