      <description>Say you are trying to install software and receive message from the operating system about untrusted certificate in certificate chain. In such case you need to import certificate of the middle-man organization into the Linux certificate storage to make things happen.&#xA;If for some reason your third-party certificate comes in DER binary format, you should convert it to CRT format:&#xA;openssl x509 -inform DER -in certificate.der -out certificate.crt Copy to storage:</description>

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-09-06 Some new parameters were added.&#xA;Note that by default all [Nightly versions] of Firefox are sending back telemetry to third-parties in extensive manner. So, to disable such malicious actions besides turning off telemetry settings via standard GUI options:&#xA;about:preferences#privacy You&amp;rsquo;ll need to use good old:&#xA;about:config To change to:&#xA;FALSE &amp;hellip;or create following parameters in software registry:&#xA;toolkit.telemetry.archive.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.unified&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.unifiedIsOptIn&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.bhrPing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.firstShutdownPing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.hybridContent.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.newProfilePing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.reportingpolicy.firstRun toolkit.</description>

      <description>I often get asked regarding Windows 7 safety especially in 2023.&#xA;&amp;#34;Is it safe to use such old operating system?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;What about security?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;How about modern viruses?&amp;#34;&#xD;.... &amp;hellip;. and many other similar questions.&#xA;Funny thing that people who are asking about security don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about privacy. Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s quite different definitions for sure, but from my point of view they always come together hand in hand.&#xA;The main and the most important security police officer is your head.</description>

      <description>Stop using mainstream operating systems like Windows 11/10/8.1, modern Linux, like Ubuntu or modern MacOS versions. On mobile Android 14/13/12/11/10/9/8.1 are prohibited because they use neural networks to profile your device and dial back to “home” to dump your personal data and preferences. iOS from very beginning was very phony platform.&#xA;My personal choices are Windows 7 for desktop and Android 8.0 for mobile. These two cover my digital needs fully, no restrictions whatsoever.</description>
