      <description>Vegas video montage software is widely known as pretty glitchy application especially if we are speaking about latest versions. Newest Vegas 21 Pro is no exception. I run into problems almost instantly. Right after i&amp;rsquo;ve decided to render video clip. Upon export attempt application showed me error:&#xA;0x80131501 How typical! To fix things up i just took DLL library [RenderAsDialog.dll, which is responsible for export dialog] from previous Vegas Pro 18 [sub-version 284 to be precise] and substituted original file with above mentioned.</description>

So, to disable such malicious actions besides turning off telemetry settings via standard GUI options:&#xA;about:preferences#privacy You&amp;rsquo;ll need to use good old:&#xA;about:config To change to:&#xA;FALSE &amp;hellip;or create following parameters in software registry:&#xA;toolkit.telemetry.archive.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.unified&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.unifiedIsOptIn&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.bhrPing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.firstShutdownPing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.hybridContent.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.newProfilePing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.reportingpolicy.firstRun toolkit.</description>

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-08-31&#xA;Not long ago i&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned about privacy-hardened [Mull browser]. Very nice Android browser, but have one serious downside: limited amount of supported addons. Yes, i like desktop convenience on the go!&#xA;To enable additional addons in mobile Firefox browser you&amp;rsquo;ll need to sideload custom addon collection tied to mozilla account. It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing fact how they like to implement overcomplicated stuff!&#xA;To create your own collection you&amp;rsquo;ll need Firefox account, but i&amp;rsquo;ll not bother to spent time on such dumb efforts.</description>
