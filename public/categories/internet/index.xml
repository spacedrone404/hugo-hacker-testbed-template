      <description>Most of you have favorite PC audio player of their own, in my case it is [Foobar2000]. In Android 6 times there was a wonderful software called [Foobar 2000 Controller]. It was made to control audio player remotely from your smartphone in a convenient way. For some reason i recall it today and decided to record installing process for future use.&#xA;Guys from [Hydrogen Audio] forum helped me out in some questions and pointed me to the right direction.</description>

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-09-06 Some new parameters were added.&#xA;Note that by default all [Nightly versions] of Firefox are sending back telemetry to third-parties in extensive manner. So, to disable such malicious actions besides turning off telemetry settings via standard GUI options:&#xA;about:preferences#privacy You&amp;rsquo;ll need to use good old:&#xA;about:config To change to:&#xA;FALSE &amp;hellip;or create following parameters in software registry:&#xA;toolkit.telemetry.archive.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.unified&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.unifiedIsOptIn&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.bhrPing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.firstShutdownPing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.hybridContent.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.newProfilePing.enabled&#xD;toolkit.telemetry.reportingpolicy.firstRun toolkit.</description>

      <description>I often get asked regarding Windows 7 safety especially in 2023.&#xA;&amp;#34;Is it safe to use such old operating system?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;What about security?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;How about modern viruses?&amp;#34;&#xD;.... &amp;hellip;. and many other similar questions.&#xA;Funny thing that people who are asking about security don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about privacy. Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s quite different definitions for sure, but from my point of view they always come together hand in hand.&#xA;The main and the most important security police officer is your head.</description>

      <title>HOW TO EXPAND LIST OF SUPPORTED ADDONS IN ANDROID FIREFOX</title>
      <link>/news/how-to-expand-list-of-supported-addons-in-android-firefox/</link>

      <description>UPDATED ON: 2023-08-31&#xA;Not long ago i&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned about privacy-hardened [Mull browser]. Very nice Android browser, but have one serious downside: limited amount of supported addons. Yes, i like desktop convenience on the go!&#xA;To enable additional addons in mobile Firefox browser you&amp;rsquo;ll need to sideload custom addon collection tied to mozilla account. It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing fact how they like to implement overcomplicated stuff!&#xA;To create your own collection you&amp;rsquo;ll need Firefox account, but i&amp;rsquo;ll not bother to spent time on such dumb efforts.</description>
