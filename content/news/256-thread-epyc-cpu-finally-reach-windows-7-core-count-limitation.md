Most of you already know how AMD substitute in terms of cores/threads count intel's pathetic'n'degenerative CPU evolution into revolution. 
<br>
Drastic changes were brought by [[Ryzen]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen) CPUs in consumer market in late 2017.
<br>
[[Threadripper]](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_threadripper) and [[Epyc]](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/epyc) lines were introduced later on [for workstation and server market respectively].

â–º [[128 core / 256 thread Epyc Bergamo CPU]](https://www.hardwaretimes.com/128-core-amd-epyc-bergamo-process-spotted-3-1ghz-boost-clock-and-a-tdp-of-360w)

It would be nice to see 256 threads in Windows 7 task manager, but i don't think that it is possible due to lack of drivers.
<br>
However there is a lil' chance that AMD will update Threadripper lineup based upon sWRX80 socket with appropriate 128-core CPUs.
<br>
In such case we have [[drivers]](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/solution-win7-8-1-drivers-for-usb-3-0-3-1-controllers-of-new-amd-chipset-systems/33603) from [[valorous Canonkong]](https://winraid.level1techs.com/u/canonkong) [Win-Raid forum].
