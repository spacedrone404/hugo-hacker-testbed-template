So you want to do something evil or make a present for the April's Fool Day to your surrounding.
<br>
Today we're going to use the professional keyboard application [[FilterKeys Setter]](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41881.0) in its meanest form,
<br>
will set keyboard filters to skip keystrokes, but only if the person starts typing at a faster rate.

I find out that the easiest way is to set <font color="red">Ignore Under</font> parameter somewhere around 60ms, 
<br>
so it will be not so obvious in the beginning for the end user, that key strokes are skipping.
<br>
To make this happen just replicate following settings on the picture:

<br>

<div align="center">

<img src="/img/key-prank/key-filter.png" width="284">

</div>

<br>
<br>

Just make sure that you checked the <font color="red">save to registry</font> option.
<br>
It ensures that settings will be remembered by OS and restored upon system reboot.
<br>
You don't even have to put this tool into startup folder.
Hit Apply & OK.

To restore default settings, just start application, turn off <font color="red">On</font> flag and hit <font color="red">Apply</font> and <font color="red">OK</font>.  

If you are worried that the program will be easily detected you can rename it to something system related: 
<br>
for example svchost.exe, to help it "hide" in Task Manager.

The most interesting part is that no matter which keyboards are hooked up or which ports are swapped 
<br>
symbol skipping will be preserved, creating an illusion that all connected keyboards/ports are broken.
  
> <font color="red">Bonus part:</font> If you are not satisfied with the above prank and you are in an office, 
<br>
where most of the computers are running on Intel HD video crap 
<br>
you can use <font color="red">[CTRL]+[ALT]+[ARROWS]</font> shortcuts [if they are enabled in system tray] to rotate the screen . 
<br>
So you can turn the screen upside down with just a few taps.
