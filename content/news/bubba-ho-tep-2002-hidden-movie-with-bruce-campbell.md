[[Bubba Ho-Tep]](https://imdb.com/title/tt0281686) is a quite awkward movie, but despite that is worth watching.
<br>
The main reasons of such conclusion are [[Bruce Campbell]](https://imdb.com/name/nm0132257) and [[Brian Tyler]](https://imdb.com/name/nm0003911).
<br>
Bruce is surely known for his [[Evil Dead]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/evil-dead-stylish-video-effects-of-90s-era) acting.
<br>
Brian provided stunning soundtrack, which lifts whole movie to another level.
