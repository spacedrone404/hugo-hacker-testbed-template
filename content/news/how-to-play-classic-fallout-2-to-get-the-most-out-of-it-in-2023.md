So you want to do a deep dive into the best RPG game of all time and don't know how do it in a right way in 2023?
<br>
You've come to the right place, coz unlisted slacker knows precisely what you need to do in the first place.

Here is a breakdown list of what you need to do to run Fallout 2 buttery smooth:

* grab original [[Fallout 2]](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout_2) distribution from GOG [latest version 2.1.0.18]
<br>
Includes sFall v3.2 and High Resolution Patch 4.1.8
* launch the game to initialize it properly, then exit
* install modern fork of [[Killap's]](http://killap.net) Restoration Project: [[RPU]](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project) by [[Burner1024]](https://devopsx.com)
* launch the game again to initialize newly installed patch, then quit
* install additional small, but very convenient fixes [[FO2Tweaks]](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/FO2tweaks)
* install highly useful [[Inventory Filter]](https://cloud.disroot.org/s/R5LGYfagTYd23nD) plugin
<br>
Original creator turned into political rave, so latest plugin revision doesn't work with English version of the game. 
<br>
So providing link to the latest compatible [v2.0]. Copy extracted archive to **MODS** folder.  
* install lossless [[hi-res version]](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2-HQ-music) of marvellous [[Mark Morgan's]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Morgan_(composer)) soundtrack
* don't hesitate to look through [[configuration guide]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/very-advanced-settings-for-classic-fallout) to fine-tune Fallout 2 to your taste
* take a note of the most coolest [[Fallout FAQ]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/ultimate-faqs-for-classic-fallouts) also
* the most optimal environment for game is: 
<br>
**Windows 7** / **DirectDraw 7** [selected in High Resolution settings] / **800x600** resolution / 8bit color


Notes regarding [[Megamod]](https://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/megamod-version-2-47-bug-reports-and-suggestions.212333):
<br>
Yeah, it's quite cool and contains plethora of new locations and features, but it's very buggy at the same time, because of enormous amount of new content.
<br>
So if you prefer to **REALLY ENJOY GAME** and **NOT SPEND YOUR TIME FIGHTING WITH BUGS** i recommend to stick with highly polished [[RPU]](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project) addon instead.
