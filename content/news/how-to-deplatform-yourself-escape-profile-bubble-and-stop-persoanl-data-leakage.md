Stop using mainstream operating systems like Windows 11/10/8.1, modern Linux, like Ubuntu or modern MacOS versions.
<br>
On mobile Android 14/13/12/11/10/9/8.1 are prohibited because they use neural networks to profile your device and dial back to “home” to dump your personal data and preferences. iOS from very beginning was very phony platform.

My personal choices are Windows 7 for desktop and Android 8.0 for mobile. These two cover my digital needs fully, no restrictions whatsoever.
<br>
Windows 7 delivers full internet support, streaming services are working without any issues. In terms of security system is safe if you are using [[current ESU updates]](https://www.ghacks.net/2022/08/09/microsoft-windows-security-updates-august-2022-overview).

In case of Android: **USE GOOD FIREWALL** like [[AFWALL+]](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.ukanth.ufirewall) [trusted and based on [[ip-tables]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables)].
<br>
You’ll need to get root privileges to make things rollin’ in a right way.
<br>
Do not forget to update your apps via [[F-droid repository]](https://f-droid.org/) [forget about google playstore].
<br>
For banking purposes never ever use Android apps, use trusted https websites.

Stop using social networks, like facebook, tweeter and google products, especially google search.
<br>
I recommend open-source search crawler [[SearX]](https://searx.space) to prevent google infestation.

If you despite everything want to get results close to google ones i can suggest [[Startpage]](https://www.startpage.com) proxy.
<br>
Service is doing anonymized search queries to google servers and return back to you the results.
<br>
However results are not identical, but they are pretty close.

Stop using messengers like whatsup, viber and telegram. All of them are completely transparent and monitored by secret services of different countries.
<br>
Most of them are selling your chats and data to telemarketing companies to simplify distribution of targeted ADs.
<br>
**Messenger, which asks you personal cellphone number immediately gets red flag with subsequent no go.**
