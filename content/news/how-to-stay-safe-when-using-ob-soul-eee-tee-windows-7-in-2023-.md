I often get asked regarding Windows 7 safety especially in 2023.

```
"Is it safe to use such old operating system?" 
"What about security?" 
"How about modern viruses?"
....

```
.... and many other similar questions.

Funny thing that people who are asking about security don't give a damn about privacy.
<br>
Yeah, that's quite different definitions for sure, but from my point of view they always come together hand in hand.

**<font color="red">The main and the most important security police officer is your head.</font>**
<br>
Use it wisely: **<font color="red">control places you visit</font>** and **<font color="red">things you are downloading</font>**.
<br>
Everything else is **<font color="red">secondary</font>**.
                                                 
Talking about auxiliary things which affect security:

* Use correctly configured [[firewall]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/agnitum-outpost-firewall-pro-advanced-protection-for-windows-7) 
<br>
[word "correctly" means that only browser and network related applications have internet access]
* Disable [[unsafe services]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/list-of-the-most-crucial-windows-7-services) and [[risky protocols]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/complete-tweaking-guide-for-windows-7-sp2-esu/#-disable-insecure-smb1-protocol-very-important) 
<br>
[user gadgets and DCOM technologies are good enough examples]
* [[Tweak security settings]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/complete-tweaking-guide-for-windows-7-sp2-esu) of operating system to minimize various risks
* Use [[latest Firefox builds]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/windows-7-x64-executes-firefox-117-nightly-version-without-any-issues) in conjunction with excellent [[Ublock]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin), [[uMatrix]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix) and other [[security plugins]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/improving-firefox-privacy-security-addons-part-1)
* Do not forget about [[advanced hardening]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/improving-firefox-privacy-security-tweaks-part-2) settings also
* Do i mention about [[Umatrix]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix) plugin?
* Keep operating system up-to-date via free [[Simplix updater]](https://blog.simplix.info/update7) 
<br>
[tool will keep you updated till October 2024]
* Do not use stupid "antivirus software", which are basically just data-mining applications, 
<br>
moreover they slowdown your computer significantly 

And remember one important and obvious thing: 


<div class="demo_line">
<b>THE MORE USER BASE OF OPERATING SYSTEM â–º THE MORE ATTACK VECTOR IS.</b>
</div>

<br>

Quite primitive logic, but it really works.
<br>
Hackers won't waste they valuable resources on target group extending on <font color="red">whooping 3% of user base</font>, 
<br>
windows 11 is more attractive with it's enormous amount of features and functions, which are begging to be hacked. 

<font color="red">I'd say even more:</font> when overall share of Windows 7 installations drops below ~0.5% virus attacks became useless by any means. 
<br>
Simply speaking Windows 7 users will be bellow noise shelf visibility to be considered or bothered with. 

Now, i'm finally done and feel completely satisfied that i've dropped another W7-bomb on you.
<br>
So, don't drink **<font color="red">CocaCola</font>** and stay safe!
