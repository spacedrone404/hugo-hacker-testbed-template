Is an ambitious project to replicate Fallout 1 world using Fallout 4 engine.
<br>
Currently game in it’s early stage of development, but location of Shady Sands was already showcased to the public. 

Developers intend to redo original voice-over because of copyright trademarks.
<br>
Moreover they are trying to copy voice aesthetics as close as possible to original Fallout 1.
<br>
Also you can already preview multiple soundtracks created by [[Radiofloyd]](https://music16403.bandcamp.com).

As for me, I **really like what they are doing**, despite the fact that I'm not fond of Fallout 3/4.
