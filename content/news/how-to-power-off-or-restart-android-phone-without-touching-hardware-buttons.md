Say you would like to extend life cycle of your hardware power button and want to turn off/restart your device without touching mechanics.
<br>
Unfortunately most of smartphones don't offer such functionality out of the box.
<br>
However there is an easy way to make things rollin'.

Problem can be solved by installing [[Power Menu]](https://github.com/visnkmr/powermenu), very small application. 
<br>
It is a simple tool which just works, do expected thing and moreover contains no bloat at all.

For convenient usage i'm using custom gesture in [[Nova Launcher]](https://novalauncher.com) to fast access Power Menu in a quick way.
<br>
Last safe **non-lagging & none-telemetry** version is 7.0.58 [2021], so take a note of this.
