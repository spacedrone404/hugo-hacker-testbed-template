As you may know [[Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact]](http://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/sony-xperia-xz1-compact-in-2021) is my main web surfing phone on the go.
<br>
I'm fully satisfied with it's capabilities even in 2023.
<br>
Except one little problem, <font color="red">related to GPS and speed of satellites detection</font>.  
<br>
Issue showed up couple of months ago and it seems that i finally found an easy way to fix it.
<br>

After some investigations i conclude that device has a hardware based problem, and to eliminate it completely 
<br>
you need to open phone casing and pull up antenna so it will have tighter surface touching with in-case metallic plate.
<br>  
I definitely not into this, because to open device in a proper way you'll need hairdryer and after appropriate manipulations 
<br>
you'll need to reglue the screen back. That's too much work for me. 

To fix issue in an easy way you just need to squeeze device in a precise place, where GPS antenna is touching metal shielding.
<br>
<font color="red">In my cause three not so hard squeezing is enough to fix the thing.</font> 
<br>
Here are some pictures for better understanding of the process.

Solution is not so technical at all, but what do you expect from obsolete retro slacker? huh?
<br>
Anyways, enjoy if i helped you out.


> Some people reported that they fixed the problem by gentle ironing back of the phone using hand.
<br>
Yeah, show some love to your device!
