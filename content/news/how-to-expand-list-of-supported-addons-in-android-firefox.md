> **UPDATED ON: 2023-08-31**

Not long ago i've already mentioned about privacy-hardened [[Mull browser]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/mull-browser-probably-the-last-sane-browser-for-android).
<br>
Very nice Android browser, but have one serious downside: **limited amount of supported addons.**
<br>
Yes, i like desktop convenience on the go!

To enable additional addons in mobile Firefox browser you'll need to sideload custom addon collection tied to mozilla account. 
<br>
It's astonishing fact how they like to implement overcomplicated stuff!

To create your own collection you'll need Firefox account, but i'll not bother to spent time on such dumb efforts. 
<br>
Quick workaround was to find credentials linked to sufficient addon list, which fits my needs. 

To enable more addons do the following:
 
```
≡ ► Settings ► About Mull 
```
Tap multiple times on Mull logo to enable hidden debug menu, then select:

```
≡ ► Settings ► Custom Add-on collection
```

For **UserID** and **Collection name** enter:

```
16201230
```
and

```
What-I-want-on-Fenix
```

Browser will be terminated automatically.
<br>
Restart application and check **Addons section** and you will be surprised with really extended list. 
<br>
[[Canvas Blocker]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker) and [[Cookie AutoDelete]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete) plugins to consider immediately.

**After installation you'll get something like this**
<br>

<br>

As you can see these plugins are purely desktop prerogative,
<br>
now successfully working on mobile version of browser. 
<br>
Be aware of the fact that not all plugins will work perfectly well!

If you don't like to mess with hidden settings and would like greater support of external addons out-of-the-box please make sure to check [[IceRaven]](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser/releases). 
<br>
Two tradeoffs here: **rarely updated, can be unstable** [program is in beta test].

List of Firefox plugins i use can be observed [[here]](https://trackerninja.codeberg.page/post/improving-firefox-privacy-security-addons-part-1).

<br>

Oh, and one more thing. 
<br>
<font color="red">Do you know that you can tune default enormous scrollbars?</font>

Just find in 

```
about:config 
```

```
widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style

```
and change it from: 

```
0
``` 
to: 

```
1 or 2 or 3
```

<br>

**That's it for today, see you around!**
