Most modern marketing smart-phones are mumbling about support of really large SD cards. But only on Hi-End models.
<br>
I'm not even speaking about pathetic iphones, which are disabled in terms of external storage due to the greed of executive directors.
<br>

In this note i will check old mastodonts like:
* [[Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact [2017]]](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz1_compact-8610.php)
* [[Nokia PureView 808 [2012]]](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_808_pureview-4577.php) 

for compatibility with such ENORMOUS storage device.

**Sony XZ1 Compact handles such capacity without any problems.**

As for Nokia.... i was just blown away. 
<br>
**It handled 1Tb card without any issues too. This is amazing.** 

Test was made in environment of latest operating system: 
<br>
[[Nokia Belle Feature Pack 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian)

> **So, for 2022 i've decided to stick with these two trusty devices.** No need for modern stuff whatsoever.
