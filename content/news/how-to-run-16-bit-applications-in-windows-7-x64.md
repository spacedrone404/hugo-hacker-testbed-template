As you may already know, there is no official ability to execute old 16-bit software in 64-bit operating systems.
<br>
So if you have favorite Windows 3.x applications such stupid restriction was a complete bummer.
<br>
But only until today! At least for me. **WinVDM** will resolve your frustration.

1. Unpack archive anywhere, execute **INSTALL** with admin privileges and you are good to go
<br>
2. After installation working state could be checked by [[Windows 3.x Calculator]](https://archive.org/details/calc_20200918)
