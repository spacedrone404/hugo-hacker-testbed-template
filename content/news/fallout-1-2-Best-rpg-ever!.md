My favorite game of all times. Thanks to it I’ve learn English [to some kind of degree] and even was almost expelled from university. 
<br>
What a neat memories. I was totally obsessed with deep "in game" atmosphere. Cyberpunk post-apocalyptic stuff, you know what I’m saying and those 
<br>
incredible ambient from master [[Mark Morgan]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Morgan_(composer)).
<br> 
<p>Can firmly confirm that modern series of this franchise don’t provide such immersion. 
<br>
<b>As for backdrop music, Mark Morgan in Fallout ½ set quality bar to unreachable level.</b></p>
