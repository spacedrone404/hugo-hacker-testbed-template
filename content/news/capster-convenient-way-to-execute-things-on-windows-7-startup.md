Although I have been using Linux more and more in recent work, 
<br>
Windows 7 remains my main production operating system.
<br>
And here is an excellent finding for Windows 7 crony named [[Capster]](https://www.bcheck.net/apps/capster.htm).
<br>
Its main functionality is to launch the specified executable at startup time when the <font color="red">[CAPS LOCK]</font> key is set to ON or OFF.
<br>
I use Capser to run backup script, that backs up previously selected folders [if i want to].         


Here are two more very useful applications at your disposal.
<br>
[[ArsClip]](http://www.joejoesoft.com/vcms/97) ► advanced clip-board manager
<br>
[[ScreenRuler]](https://sourceforge.net/projects/screenruler) ► neat on-screen measuring tool  

<br>

>Super bonus part:
<br>
Lost mouse cursor on a big screen? Hit CTRL to highlight it by shrinking circles.
<br>
Of course you must enable this feature to use such functionality.

```
Control Panel ► Mouse ► Pointer Options ► Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key
```
