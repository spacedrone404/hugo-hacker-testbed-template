Vegas video montage software is widely known as pretty **glitchy application** especially if we are speaking about latest versions.
<br>
Newest Vegas 21 Pro is no exception. I run into problems almost instantly.
<br>
Right after i've decided to render video clip.
<br>
Upon export attempt application showed me error:
```
0x80131501 
```
<font color="red">How typical!</font>
<br>
To fix things up i just took DLL library [<font color="red">RenderAsDialog.dll</font>, which is responsible for export dialog] from previous 
<br>
Vegas Pro 18 [sub-version 284 to be precise] and substituted original file with above mentioned.

RenderAsDialog.dll can be downloaded [[here]](https://mega.nz/file/nhh3iBKa#KRo6jRICfQ4CQHYJ2kmYTnDsrcibkR1wE-Gspi2_xlc).
<br>
File is packed with [[7zip]](https://7-zip.org).

You can rename original file into something like <font color="red">RenderAsDialog.dll_</font> before copying over. 
<br>
Just to be safe if something goes wrong.
 
Original file location is here:

```
C:\Program Files\VEGAS\Vegas Pro 21\RenderAsDialog.dll 
```

On positive side Vegas 21 STILL works in Windows 7 without any problems.
