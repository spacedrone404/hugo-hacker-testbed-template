This can be done by changing application's language locale to English.
<br>
But what if you have only one non-English language in GUI preferences?

The solution is surprisingly simple.

* Close Photoshop if it is already running

* Find following file:

```
tw10428.dat
```

Standard location:

```
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop YOUR-VERSION\Locales\YOUR-LANGUAGE\Support Files\
```

In case of Photoshop 2020 file is named:

```
tw10428_Photoshop_ru_RU.dat 
```

* Rename it into something like:

```
tw10428.dat.bak
``` 

* Ta-da! Start software and enjoy!
