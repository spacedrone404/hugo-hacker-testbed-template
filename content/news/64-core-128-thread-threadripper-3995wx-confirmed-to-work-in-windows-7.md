Well known Chinese driver modder [[Canonkong]](https://winraid.level1techs.com/u/canonkong/summary) confirmed that [[64-cores/128-threads Threadripper 3995WX]](https://www.amd.com/en/support/cpu/amd-ryzen-pro-processors/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-processors/amd-ryzen-threadripper) 
<br>
based upon sWRX8 chipset works flawlessly in Windows 7 environment.
<br>
Considering the news it looks like that more recent [[5995WX]](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-5995wx) will also work without any issues. 
<br>
So, we have plenty of headroom in terms of system performance.
<br>
As for me, i have no need to switch to "recent operating systems" like Windows 10/11.
 

Here is brief [[confirmation]](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/solution-win7-8-1-drivers-for-usb-3-0-3-1-controllers-of-new-amd-chipset-systems/33603/797?u=spacedrone808) from the WinRaid forum:

```
Yes, wrx80 already tested. It is working fine.

```

Such statement means that Windows 7 users can use octal-memory configurations paired with [[3995WX]](https://www.amd.com/en/support/cpu/amd-ryzen-pro-processors/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-processors/amd-ryzen-threadripper) / [[5995WX]](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-5995wx) CPUs!
<br>
Prior to this day i thought that 3990x is the most fastest cpu, which can be used under Windows 7.
