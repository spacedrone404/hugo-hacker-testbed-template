I think that people are sicking tired of cheap computer graphics. Everything is so plastic and unnaturally glossy these days. 
<br>
**Miss those real video effects from early 90s.** And yeah, they were so atmospheric, especially amplified effect of beam light coming out of backdrop. 
<br>
Evil Dead is very neat example, just look at these pieces. **Make sure to watch S-Mart scene!**
